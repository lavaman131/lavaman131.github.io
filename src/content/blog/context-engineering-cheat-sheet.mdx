When building production ML systems, you've likely hit the bottlenecks where your models struggle with domain-specific tasks, real-time information access, and personalized responses. In addition, comprehensive dataset creation costs to help alleviate these problems are steep and can be difficult to obtain depending on the use case. Context engineering, or the systematic application of context retrieval, context processing, generation, and management techniques, addresses this by providing models with targeted information at inference time. This helps to eliminate the need for massive specialized training datasets.

Based on "A Survey of Context Engineering for Large Language Models" [\[1\]](#resources), we've developed a Context Engineering Navigator that allows you to search and explore the foundational methods from the paper's theoretical framework. This post covers the core components such as context retrieval and generation strategies, context processing methodologies, and context management systems that enable models to access personalized, current information without continuous retraining overhead.

Context engineering approaches will inevitably evolve with new model architectures, but the fundamental principle of efficiently supplying models with relevant external information remains critical for scaling AI systems. Instead of waiting years for comprehensive datasets to emerge, context engineering delivers immediate performance improvements across specialized domains and dynamic information requirements.

Reference this technical guide to identify which context engineering methods suit your specific implementation needs. You can select a category between **All Categories**, **Context Retrieval & Generation**, **Context Processing**, and **Context Management**, then explore the different frameworks and methods in detail by clicking on specific items to learn how they work, when to use them, and review use cases with references to the original paper. At the end, we've also included additional resources for context engineering that we've found most effective when deploying these techniques in real-world systems.
