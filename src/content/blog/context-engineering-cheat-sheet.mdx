Context engineering is the discipline of designing, constructing, and managing dynamic systems that provide language models with the right information, tools, and instructions in the optimal format and at the right time. This interactive cheat sheet covers the comprehensive landscape of context engineering techniques.

<ContextNavigator />

This interactive cheat sheet provides a comprehensive overview of context engineering techniques for Large Language Models. Click on any technique to see detailed information including how it works, when to use it, use cases, and the corresponding section from the research literature.

The techniques are organized into four main categories:

## 🔍 Context Retrieval & Generation
Techniques for gathering and generating relevant context, including prompt engineering strategies, learning approaches, and retrieval-augmented generation methods.

## ⚙️ Context Processing  
Methods for efficiently processing long contexts, including architectural innovations, optimization techniques, and memory management approaches.

## 🧠 Context Management
Systems for organizing, storing, and utilizing contextual information, including memory hierarchies, compression techniques, and intelligent management strategies.

## 🔧 Dynamic Context Assembly
Frameworks and tools for dynamically assembling context from multiple sources, including automated prompt engineering and tool integration approaches.

Each technique entry provides:
- **How it works**: Technical description of the approach
- **When to use**: Appropriate scenarios and conditions  
- **Use case**: Specific applications and examples
- **Section of paper**: Reference to the corresponding research literature

Use the search functionality to find specific techniques or filter by category to explore different aspects of context engineering. This resource serves as a practical reference for implementing context engineering solutions in production LLM systems.
