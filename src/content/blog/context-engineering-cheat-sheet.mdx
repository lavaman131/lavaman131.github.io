Based on our reading of “A Survey of Context Engineering for Large Language Models”
that has broad implications, we'll be providing a cheat sheet and discussion covering the topics in the paper.

This post focuses on the theoretical foundational components of context engineering, including context retrieval and generation, context processing, and context management, and provides a summarized cheat sheet for navigating this space outlined in red below. Future cheats will further cover the implementations of these foundational components.

Although context engineering as a concept may shift with new model architectures or other changes, it will most likely evolve over time in approaches and principles across layers but will still exist as a way to provide models with personalized, up-to-date, relevant information. It also serves as a way to navigate the existing challenges we have with generating large datasets that give models the capability to handle difficult problems. These datasets are expensive to create and will take time to develop properly as society shifts into the AI age.

We encourage you to reference this cheat sheet to determine which parts, depending on your AI use case, you want to dive deeper into. For each section, we've provided sample use cases that may best apply to the methodology and cited back to the original section in the paper.

At the end we've also included additional resources in the [Resources](#resources) section for context engineering that we've found most useful when building AI systems in the real world.
