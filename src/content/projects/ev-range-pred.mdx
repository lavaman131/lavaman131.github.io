## Introduction

In recent years, more and more people are buying Electrical Vehicles
(EVs) for environmental, aesthetic, and financial reasons. The number of
car companies inventing EVs for their brand are increasing. Companies
such as Tesla, Ford, and Rivian are taking advantage of this move toward
EVs. The goal of our project is to examine just how much the range of
EVs changes due to other factors such as battery pack. In this paper we
analyze the relation between the range and other variables such as
acceleration, top speed, battery pack, efficiency, fast charge and price
in order to give us a deeper understanding of what element influences
the range of EVs the most. Additionally, we can also see what car
manufacturers should do to improve their EVs, and provide useful data
for car companies.


## Background

### Dataset

Divyanshu Gupta, Kaggle (2021), Cars Dataset with Battery Capacity Data File. Retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/divyanshugupta95/cars-dataset-with-battery-pack-capacity).

### Data Collection Method

The data was collected from different companies such as Tesla, Porsche,
BMW. The data set also gives us the specific make and model of the cars.
The dataset contains 14 explanatory variables with 1 response variable
and a total of 102 data points.


## Preliminary Analysis

### Hypothesized Variables That Impact Electric Vehicle Range

The main covariate that we believe will have the largest impact on the
range of an electric vehicle is battery packs in kilowatts per hour. The
other variables that we are looking at would be acceleration, top speed,
efficiency, how fast the car charges, and price. Qualitative variables
would be the plug style, number of seats, power train (all wheel drive
vs. four wheel drive), and type of car. This mix of qualitative and
quantitative variables will allow us to give a clearer understanding of
how different factors affect the range of EVs.

### Exploring Influence of Outliers

We tested different outlier removal methods such as taking away data
that was two and three standard deviations away from mean. Figure 1
compares the linear relationship of covariates against Range_Km with and
without outliers respectively:

<Image src={outliers} alt="outliers" />

After analyzing the best-fit lines with and without outliers we went on
to analyze the corresponding residual plots. Figure 2 compares the
residual plots of covariates against Range_Km with and without outliers
respectively:

<Image src={outliersResidual} alt="outliersResidual" />

We found a minimal difference in the strength of the linear relationship
(measured with $R^2$) between the covariates and response variable when
filtering outliers. Additionally, our dataset is relatively small with
102 samples. For these reasons, we decided not to remove outliers for
further stages of our analysis.

### Normal Quantile Plot

In order to verify one of the central assumptions of linear regression,
normally distributed residuals, we created a Q-Q plot in Figure 3 for
all of our covariates to observe that this assumption holds true for
most of our covariates.

<Image src={quantile} alt="normalQuantile" />

## Transformations

Analyzing most of the residuals we can see that most of them are random,
normally distributed, independent, and show homoscedasticity. However,
these conditions are not met for the covariates Battery pack and Price
in Euro. For this reason, we decided that it is important to transform
Battery pack and Price in Euro.

We tested two conventional transformations. First, we applied square
root transformations on Battery pack and Price in Euro. Next, we applied
log transformations to the two covariates. We determined that the log
transformations led to a stronger linear relationship ($R^2$) so our
final transformation was a log transform on Battery Pack and Price.
Figure 4 shows the improved residual plots after the log transformation:

## Main Results

### Multicollinearity

We created a correlation coefficient matrix (Figure 5) in order to test
for multicollinearity within our covariates. Range was highly correlated
with all of our covariates which is a good sign that our model is
predictive of range. We noticed that acceleration has a negative
correlation with most of the other variables including range. The
efficiency coefficient had the lowest correlation coefficient with range
at 0.48. There is high correlation between price and our other
covariates, and we believe there is evidence of multicollinearity
because of the high correlation coefficient. Removing price may reduce
the multicollinearity issues we encounter. It may be best to use a
stepwise forward regression, to allow the model to remove covariates
that are causing multicollinearity.

<Image src={corr} alt="correlation" />

With the covariates that remained after feature selection, we measured multicollinearity using the variance inflation factor (VIF) given by:

$$
VIF_i = \frac{1}{1 - {R_i}^2}
$$

The result (Table 3) shows that all of the selected covariates are below 5, which means that they will not have multicollinearity. The variable TopSpeed is less significant than the other covariates, but because it is significant at the 5% level and has a VIF level below 10, we believe it should still be included for analysis.

### Model Fit

The transformations that we included in our model included the log of
price and log of battery pack. We achieved a perfect ${R_a}^2$ value and
realized that the car Model and brand covariate had a high cardinality
(factor levels were equal to the number of data points in this case),
hence, causing overfitting (over-generalization) of the fitted model.
For this reason, we removed the a Model and brand covariate and were
left with a much more applicable adjusted ${R_a}^2$ and low RMSE that
predicts range.

After we used forward selection as our variable selection method and set
p-value enter is 0.25 and p-value leave as 0.1, we determined our final
model to be as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{y} = & -909.39 + 0.29x_1 + 39.04x_2 - 2.08x_3 + 288.90x_4 \\
& - 28.80x_5 + 8.22x_6 - 45.13x_7 - 52.62x_8 \\
& + 70.71x_9 + 43.78x_{10}
\end{aligned}
$$

where $x_i$ are listed in the table below:

We found our final model to be adequate as it had a high ${R_a}^2$ and
all of the covariates we found were significant at the $\alpha = 0.05$
level. The reason we used forward selection is to remove the issue of
multicollinearity and it was the simplest and easiest model. Figure 9
shows the performance of our model. Some points to highlight are that
our model's ${R_a}^2$ is 0.949, has a statistically significant $F$
statistic of 189.061 in the ANOVA test.

### Model Interpretation

There is a natural interpretation of the covariates in that each one
shows us how much they affect the range of EVs. The data we got shows
that the battery pack does affect the range the most. Other than the
powertrain covariate, all of the data was significant at the 5% level of
significance. We found how the different body styles of cars can affect
the range as well.


## Conclusion

Based on the results of our model we can see that there is a strong
positive correlation between battery pack and range. This can help
consumers and car manufacturers when designing new EVs to create larger
battery packs and understand that with the combination of Bodystyle we
can see which are the best cars for range. For example, Cabrio or
convertibles and hatchbacks have the greatest impact on range with their
coefficient being 42. SUVs and pickup trucks for example have a negative
effect on range.

Another interesting covariate we found was how rapid charge effects
range, with it being the third largest $\beta$ that we found. This makes
sense as charging cars will lead to more range for the car, it could
make the car more efficient. The price was also another factor that
impacts range, one that makes sense as price increases, the technology
and range of the EV increases as well. Our model allows car
manufacturers, consumers, and investors to understand the factors of EVs
that most affect range allowing for better improvement of EVs for the
future, improving the environment and lowering the market for gas
powered vehicles.
